As a high schooler,

I want to be presented with a box of pieces just like a real standard model set.
I want to be able to drag and drop bonds onto atoms and atoms onto bonds and have them add-on as 3D objects.
I want to be able to click a bond to turn it into a double bond, a double into a triple, and a triple into a quadruple.
I don't want to be able to accidentally create an impossible (or incredibly unlikely) molecule.
I want to be able to rotate the molecule around single bonds so that I can position everything properly.

As a teacher,
I want to be able to save my molecules so that I can easily retrieve them before class to show my students.
I want the students to be able to easily retrieve my molecules on their own computer.

**Extras**
As a user, I want to click a button and see dipole moments, because those are difficult to determine even with a real kit! 
As a user, I want to be able to click a button and fill any empty holes with hydrogens.
As a user, I want to see labels on my atoms so I know what each atom represents.
